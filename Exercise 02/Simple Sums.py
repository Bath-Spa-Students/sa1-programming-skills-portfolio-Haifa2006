#Exercie 02 - Simple Sums
"""In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arith-
metic operations, and print the result to the console.

Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console."""

# Answer:
#1. Declaring a variable and initializing it with the integer value 8.
Number1 = 8

#2. Declaring a second variable and intializing it with the integer value 10.
Number2 = 10

#3. Declaring a third variable which will be storing the sum of two numbers.
Total_sum = Number1 + Number2

#4. Print the value of the sum to the console.
print("The total sum is:",Total_sum)
