#If else statement practice

#Storing 250 in variable a
a = 250
#Storing 25 in variable b
b = 25
#Comparing if variable b is greater than variable a 
if b > a:
 #Print this message if the condition is true
 print ("b is greater than a")
 #Print this message if the condition is false
else:
 print("a is greater than b")
