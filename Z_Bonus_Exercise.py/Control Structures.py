#Control Structures:
"""Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and
assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message
that the player just earned 5 points.
•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The
version that fails will have no output.)"""

#Answers:
#Setting the color for the alien
alien_color = "Green"

#Verify if the alien's color is green
if alien_color == "Green":
    print("Well done! You've scored 5 points.")


#Setting the color for the alien
alien_color = "Red"

#Verify if the alien's color is green
if alien_color == "green":
    print("Well done! You've scored 5 points.")
